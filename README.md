## About Project

The Microfrontend Orchestrator is a platform that enables seamless, dynamic composition of multiple independent microfrontends in a single user interface.
Each microfrontend represents a specific functional component of the application, In this case we have 2 totally independent projects
the orchestrated project of the host :5001 is an application that loads the content of the [Rick and morty](https://rickandmortyapi.com) api
and the host :5002 loads the content of [The simpsons](https://simpsonsapi.000webhostapp.com) api.
The orchestrator acts as a conducting conductor, assembling these microfrontends into a cohesive and seamless user experience.
